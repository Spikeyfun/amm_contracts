# Spikey AMM Contracts

Welcome to the Spikey AMM (Automated Market Maker) Contracts repository, maintained by Spikey Labs. This project is a fork of the original AMM contracts developed by Razor Labs, adapted and enhanced for deployment on the Supra blockchain.

## Overview

Spikey Labs has forked the Razor Labs AMM contracts to create a robust and secure AMM tailored for the Supra blockchain ecosystem. While preserving the core functionality of the original AMM, we have introduced targeted improvements to enhance security and compatibility, ensuring seamless integration with third-party platforms and full support for legacy coins.

### Key Modifications
- **Enhanced Oracle Modules**: We have upgraded the oracle integration to improve security and reliability, making the AMM more robust for third-party platform integrations.
- **Legacy Coin Support**: The AMM has been adapted to fully support legacy coins, ensuring compatibility with existing token standards on the Supra blockchain.
- **Core Preservation**: The heart of the original AMM remains intact, with modifications focused on optimizing performance and compatibility for Supra's unique blockchain environment.
